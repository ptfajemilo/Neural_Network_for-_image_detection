# Neural_Network_for-_image_detection
A neural network model was developed using a tensorflow for a mnist dataset to predict the type/kind of image whether is a t-shirt, shoe or pullover
More than 6000 images was used for this model and the images were classified into training and testing dataset.
I used keras.sequential for the modelling, with one input layer, one hidden layer and one output layer.
'Adam' optimizer was used, with 'sparse_categorical_crossentropy' for the cost function.
The prediction was carried out and the evaluation. The accuracy of the evaluation is about 88% which shows that the model is okay.
